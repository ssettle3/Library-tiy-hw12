        I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech, and a hell of an engineer—
        A helluva, helluva, helluva, helluva, hell of an engineer.
        Like all the jolly good fellows, I drink my whiskey clear.
        I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech and a hell of an engineer.

        Oh! If I had a daughter, sir, I'd dress her in White and Gold,
        And put her on the campus to cheer the brave and bold.
        But if I had a son, sir, I'll tell you what he'd do—
        He would yell, 'To hell with Georgia!' like his daddy used to do.

        Oh, I wish I had a barrel of rum and sugar three thousand         pounds,
        A college bell to put it in and a clapper to stir it round.
        I'd drink to all the good fellows who come from far and near.
        I'm a ramblin', gamblin', hell of an engineer!
